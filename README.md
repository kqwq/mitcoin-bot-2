# Mitcoin Bot 2.0

Exactly like the original Mitcoin Bot but with a new taxation/donation system.

- Users can request another user to pay taxes. 
  - This action forces the targetted user to pay between 2-10% tax (affects both money and mitcoin).
  - The "pay taxes" cooldown is 24 hours
- Users can donate money (or mitcoin) to other users.
- Users that have donated money to another player in the last 24 hours are immune to paying taxes.
- These 3 actions (pay taxes, donate money, donate mitcoin) can be executed by right clicking a user's message, selecting the "Apps" option, then selecting the appropriate action.
